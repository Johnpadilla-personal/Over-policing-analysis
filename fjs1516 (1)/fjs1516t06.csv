"Note: Includes information on felony defendants, Class A misdemeanants—whether handled by U.S. district court judges or U.S. magistrates—and other misdemeanants provided they were handled by U.S. district court judges. Most serious offense at termination is determined by court personnel as the offense with the greatest statutory-maximum sentence. The unit of count is a defendant in a case terminated in U.S. district court. Defendants terminated in more than one case are counted separately. The median is the midpoint when processing time is sorted from slowest to fastest. A median of 214 days means that half of the defendants received a disposition in fewer than 214 days and half of the defendants received a disposition in more than 214 days. Details may not sum to totals due to rounding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*Includes the interval from the time a case is filed in U.S. district court through sentencing for those convicted and the interval from case filing through disposition for those not convicted or those whose cases were dismissed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
