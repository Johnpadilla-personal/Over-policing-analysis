Note: The unit of count is a suspect in a matter referred to U.S. attorneys. Suspects investigated in more than one matter are counted separately. Lead charge was missing for 49 matters. Details may not sum to totals due to rounding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a/Prosecutor case-processing time reflects the time from receipt of a matter to the prosecutor’s decision to prosecute as a case in U.S. district court, refer for disposal by a U.S. magistrate, or decline the matter, resulting in no further action. The median is the midpoint of processing time. A median of zero means that half of the suspects received a disposition on the same day as the matter was referred.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b/Lead charge is the substantive statute that is the primary basis for referral. It is most often the charge with the greatest potential sentence, but not always.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
