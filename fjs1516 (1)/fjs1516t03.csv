Percentages are based on records with non-missing referring authority information (268 records were missing the referring authority in 2006, 236 records in 2014, 71 records in 2015, and 41 records in 2016). The unit of count is a suspect in a matter referred to U.S. attorneys. Suspects in more than one matter are counted separately. A matter is opened when a federal prosecutor spends one hour or more investigating.  Details may not sum to totals due to rounding.",,,,,,,,,
