"Note: The unit of count is a defendant in a case terminated with a conviction and sentence in U.S. district court. Defendants convicted and sentenced in more than one case are counted separately. The most serious offense is determined by court personnel as the offense with the greatest statutory maximum sentence. The median prison term is the midpoint of prison terms imposed. For example, a median of 30 months means that half of the defendants received a prison term of fewer than 30 months and half of the defendants received a prison term of more than 30 months. Sentence type was missing for 296 records in 2016. Details may not sum to totals due to rounding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
--Less than 0.05%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*Includes sentences to incarceration such as mixed (a prison term followed by a probation term) and life sentences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
